		<h1>Tutorial: Modal - Events</h1>

		<p>
			In the <a href="/docs/modal.html">previous section</a> we've created a
			component that renders a <strong>Modal</strong>. Its close button doesn't
			do anything yet though. This section will teach you how to handle dom
			events on your components.

		<h2>Listener implementation</h2>

		<p>
			All you need to do now is to implement the <code>close</code> function in
			your <strong>src/Modal.js</strong> file:
		</p>

		<textarea class="code" data-mode="javascript">
			{literal}close() {
  this.dispose();
}{/literal}
		</textarea>

		<p>
			All components have this <code>dispose</code> function, which basically
			destroys it and removes its content from the dom. Check the guide
			about <a href="/docs/component-lifecycle.html">lifecycle functions</a> for
			more details.
		</p>

		<h2>Run the demo</h2>

		<p>
			Now compile your code with <code>npm run build</code> and open the demo
			on a browser. Clicking the <strong>x</strong> button will close the modal
			as expected.
		</p>

		<p>
			For more details on inline listeners check <a href="/docs/inline-events.html">this guide</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Next steps</h2>

		<p>
			Our modal now properly closes itself when the <strong>x</strong> button is
			clicked. To do this we're disposing of it completely though, so we'll need
			to create a new Modal instance whenever we need to show it again.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ideally, instead of disposing it, we should just hide it instead, while
			also having a way to show it back. The next section will explain how to do
			this by having data changes update the modal accordingly.
		</p>
