		<h1>Building</h1>

		<p>
			As we mentioned before, <strong>Metal.js</strong> components are written
			in ES6, which means that we need a transpiling process before using it on
			a website.
		<p>

		<p>
			This can be done via any tools that you prefer,
			like <a href="http://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a> or <a href="http://browserify.org/">browserify</a>,
			but we've also published a few tools of our own, which focuses
			on <strong>Metal.js</strong> projects, which we'll talk about here.
		</p>

		<h2 id="gulp-metal">gulp-metal</h2>

		<p>
			What this package offers is a a bunch
			of <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a> tasks. There are tasks that can
			handle not only building javascript, as well as soy compilation,
			testing, linting and many other things.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <a href="/docs/">tutorials</a> we've provided are all using it,
			though indirectly, through some npm scripts. To learn how to
			use <strong>gulp-metal</strong> directly take a look at
			its <a href="http://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-metal">npm page</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>metal-cli</h2>

		<p>
			If you're not a fan of <strong>gulp</strong> you can still
			use <a href="http://www.npmjs.com/package/metal-cli">metal-cli</a>, which
			offers almost the same tools, but through the command line.
		</p>

		<h2>Examples using other tools</h2>

		<p>
			As was mentioned before,
			using <strong>gulp-metal</strong> or <strong>metal-cli</strong> is not
			required. You can use your favorite build tool
			with <strong>Metal.js</strong> as well.
		</p>

		<p>
			We've created a github repository full of different examples on how to work
			with <strong>Metal.js</strong>, and among other things it has a bunch of
			examples showing how to use different build
			tools. <a href="http://github.com/metal/metal-examples">Check it out</a>,
			and feel free to create an issue or send a pull request for other tools
			that it may be missing.
